# odin-recipes

This is a basic recipe website. It consists of a home page and links to 3 recipe pages. 
Each recipe has an image of the finished dish, a description, a list of ingredients, 
and a list of steps. 

Through this project, I learned the basics of HTML, how to clone a git repository on my 
computer, how to make atomic commits, and how to navigate with the command line.
