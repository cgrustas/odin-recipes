    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato 
        sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling
         would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage
          cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad 
          and crusty garlic bread.</p>
